# An-AI-powered-network-thread-detection-system
 AI@NTDS, that uses the behavioral features of attackers and intelligent techniques. The proposed AI@NTDS system combines data analysis, feature extraction, and feature evaluation to construct a detection model, which supports a more straightforward strategy by which the operating system or its operators can defend against network attacks.

AI@NTDS system has three levels, depending on the attacker’s attacks and the user’s risk of damage. Fiftytwo features are used to detect the network threat level. The features contain message-based features for all kinds of Linux operating instructions, host-based features for all types of information in the network
connection process, and geography-based features are related to the attacker’s location

 AI-based algorithms LightGBM, Random Forest and the K-NN algorithm are used to verify the identification of the custom features. Finally, the detection model that is trained using the best combination of features is used to predict the test dataset.
  an AI@NTDS detection system that incorporates the LightGBM machine learning algorithm for identifying and classifying threats. Attackers’ intentions are
analyzed using collected data, and the degree of harm that is caused by malicious instructions is determined. Three types of attack are identified by threat levels of attack are identi- fied using Enterprise Tactics of MITRE ATT&CK. A total of 52 features of three types - message-based, host-based, and geography-based features - are ultimately identified. The results of an analysis demonstrate that our model performed best when all features were used.
